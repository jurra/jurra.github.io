<h2>Interaction Design for a physical environment</h2>
<p>I designed this table with an activity centered approach. It was concieved for a shared workplace for a couple. <br>
I considered also cleaning as a crucial factor, that is why it has no legs. It is also design to handle wires and mount monitors.
The displays can move freely accross the table allowing.

<h3>Enabling complex activities like music composition</h3>
<p>The work place concieves the display also as a workspace to compose music. This is why the displays are hanging from behind</p>
