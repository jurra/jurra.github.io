Done: Stackable grid for buttons

Done: Change font size of left column
# Make animated button to point down, and white screen on top of content
Done: stick the buttons in big screen view to the bottom, perhaps this can be the animation
Done: Test loading html instead of json file/ wordpress concept

Done: load html with jquery

Done :Create an npm server (this was to use it incase load of html was needed)

#Done to be started:
	Resize the image of the 2nd big column so that it stays at the height of the viewport

	Upload Project Slides

issues:
Should I load the full data or only the object by reffering to the index??


#Done: Publish in google drive
		It was not feasible in drive but in github.

# Ongoing: Check performance speed and how the structure can be improved

				Test the idea of returning the object[index] getting out of the $get.json function scope the operation on top of html.

						Test this in a separate json file

				Avoiding shakiness of Jquery loading, wait until Jquery is loaded
