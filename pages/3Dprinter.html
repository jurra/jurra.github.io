<h2>Sharing 3D models on the web: What for?</h2>
	<p>Rich and interactive presentation of 3d documents is a new add on to the paradigm of Internet of Things. It captures information of objects, but also their relations, it facilitates understanding, explanation, discussions, but also aggregation of new layers of information.
	When we also conisder the vision of the semantic web, we can see objects as manifestations of complex relations, embedding contextual and tangible knowledge to the users.<br><br> These models can become tangible entities as CAD/CAM specifications to manufacture them, incorporating not only the manufacturing instructions, but also the context of the object. This vision would allow to blend the open source lifecycle within the object as a carrier of knowledge.

	<h2>Working for Open Source Ecology: a social enterprise</h2>

	<p>This experiment was part of the work I do at Open Source Ecology. I share in the video below just one of the many weekly meetings we have to develop the projects.
		This is a show case of my experience in working remotely and collaborating in complex projects, where a lot of discipline and commitment is needed.
