<h1>Highlights of the design process</h1>
<h3>A rich and interdisciplinary experience</h3>
<p>One of the aspects that I enjoyed the most in this project was that I was working in an agile team, where software engineers, psychologists, a graphic designer and I worked together.<br>
	<p class="ui basic segment" style="font-size:18px;font-style:italic; padding:5%">This was my first practical experience with <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-84800-907-3_3">Activity Centered Design and Modeling</a>. I introduced the framework in this project to scope, analyze and design use cases.</p>

<p>We had a continuous process of conceptualizing, framing requirements and developing mockups with "Balsamiq mockups" tools before implementation. This was an iterative process where feasibility and desirability where in constant tension. The figure below shows some of the documents that were generated to discuss possible development paths and solutions.<br><br>

The graphic designer would take the lead in terms of colors styling, iconography. In this project the roles of graphic and interaction design were mingled dynamically, having more weight UI at the beggining and then focusing more on styles and iconography at the end.</p>
