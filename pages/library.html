<h1>Concept: Blending search and navigation</h1>
<p>The novel proposal for this project (from a purely UX perspective) was to integrate with the navigation experience a nested search on collections.<br><br>
The user has then not only the classicla search with filters. Also along the navigation, filters can be added when a search is done on top of a document(object). For instance which other topics are related, readed, or has content related to this object.<br><br>
The most important idea behind this concept is to provide contextual data based on the content retrieved by the user. Still the user is also able to add other filters once the search panel is shown.<br><br>
