<h1>Concept: Blending search and navigation</h1>
<p>The novel proposal for this project (from a purely UX perspective) was to integrate with the navigation experience a nested search on collections.<br><br>
The user has then not only the classicla search with filters. Also along the navigation, filters can be added when a search is done on top of a document(object). For instance which other topics are related, readed, or has content related to this object.
