#Done to be started:
	Resize the image of the 2nd big column so that it stays at the height of the viewport

	Upload Project Slides

issues:
Should I load the full data or only the object by reffering to the index??


#Done: Publish in google drive
		It was not feasible in drive but in github.

# Ongoing: Check performance speed and how the structure can be improved

				Test the idea of returning the object[index] getting out of the $get.json function scope the operation on top of html.

						Test this in a separate json file

				Avoiding shakiness of Jquery loading, wait until Jquery is loaded
